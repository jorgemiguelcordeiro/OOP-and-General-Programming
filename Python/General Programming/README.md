# K-Means Clustering Algorithm Implementation

The three projects presented in this repository were developed as part of the Programming for Data Science course in my Master's degree. The most significant project is Project 3, outlined here.

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

This project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch as part of my Master's degree coursework. K-Means is one of the most popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms used for partitioning data into distinct non-overlapping clusters.

While pre-built implementations are available in libraries like scikit-learn, this project focuses on developing a custom implementation to:
- Gain deeper understanding of the algorithm's inner workings
- Develop the ability to customize algorithms for specific problems
- Build fundamental skills for when library implementations are insufficient

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

- Implement K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch
- Visualize the clustering process and results
- Compare the custom implementation with scikit-learn's version
- Analyze the algorithm's performance on different datasets
- Explore the impact of different initialization methods


## ðŸ“š Lessons Learned

Through this implementation, I gained insights into:
- The importance of proper initialization in clustering algorithms
- Trade-offs between computational efficiency and accuracy
- How distance metrics affect cluster formation
- The challenges of determining the optimal number of clusters
- Methods for evaluating clustering performance without ground truth labels
